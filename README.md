# Credit-Card-Fraud-Pytorch

### Credit Card Fraud Classification using Pytorch

###### Objective of the project is to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a tutorial for those who wants to get acquainted with Pytorch<br />
Very few tutorials are available for data loading process for tabular data<br />
All hyperparameters have been tuned<br />
A basic Deep Neural Network has been built<br />
For performance one can check the classification report and confusion matrix<br />
Class weights has not been used since performance is worse<br />
A balance between Precision and Recall was the main focus
